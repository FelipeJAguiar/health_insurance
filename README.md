#### This project was based on kaggle's challenge and made by Felipe Aguiar. All context about company are fictitious.

# Business Problem.
Insurance All is a health insurance company looking for expand its business, introducing in the market a new product: a car insurance. To understand how potential customers' buying propensity works and optimizing contact process (limited in 20 thousand calls) , the sales center requested for a data solution based on a recently research made by the departament. 
So the business problem is:

üëâ Provide a rank of clients that have more propensity to purchase a car insurance. 

# Business Assumptions
Business assumptions made were divided in two topics: 

1 - Provide a Google Sheets doc that, inputing a customer data, returns customer propensity. 

2 - Answer some questions to understand and quantify business assumptions related with model performance.

   üü™ What percentage of interested customers, could the sales center contact by calling 20,000?
   
   üü™ What percentage of interested customers, could the sales center contact by calling 40,000?
   
   üü™ To contact 80% of interested customers, how many calls does the center sales needs to make?

# Solution Strategy

 ### What is the solution?
 Ranking customers by the car insurance propensity purchase.
 
 ### How to provide the solution?
 Making available a Google Sheets spreadsheet, that rank and show customers by propensity purchase.  

### Strategy to solve this challenge was:

The method used to base the solution project was CRISP cicle, adopting some steps to it. Below an image representing CRISP and steps defined.

# Top 3 Data Insights

<b>Hypothesis 01</b>: Owners of newers vehicles are more interested in taking out insurance.

‚ùåFALSE: Owners of vehicles that are between 1 and 2 years, are the most interested in taking out insurance.

<b>Hypothesis 02</b>: Young people are less interested in taking out insurance.

‚úÖTRUE: Young people (age less than 30 years old) are less interested in taking out insurance, comparing with other ages (old and middle ages).

<b>Hypothesis 03</b>: Customers that have between 200 to 299 days contract time, are more interested in taking out insurance.

‚úÖTRUE: Customers that have 200 days or more contract time, are more interested in taking out insurance, comparing others customers.

# Machine Learning Model Applied

Being a Learn to Rank (rank propensity score for each customer) problem, some classifier models were tested. Below, the metrics for each model trained:

|Model Name		       |PRECISION @K		  |RECALL @K  	|PRECISION @K CV  |RECALL	@K CV  |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
|KNN 	               |0.348 	          |0.047        |0.342            |0.057         |
|Logistic Regression |0.303             |0.041        |0.305            |0.051         |
|Extra Trees			   |0.346	            |0.047        |0.332            |0.055         |
|Random Forest	     |0.346 	          |0.047	      |0.357            |0.060         |
|XGBoost          	 |0.452             |0.061	      |0.416            |0.069         |
|LGBM	               |0.460 	          |0.062	      |0.425            |0.071         |

To improve the comparative visualization, a cumulative gains curve was plotted. Cumulative gains curve is an evaluation curve that demonstrates the model performance. Shows percentage of targets reached when considering a certain percentage of the population most likely to be targeted according to the model. We can see in the next plot, a comparative cumulative gains curve of all trained models.

According metrics obtained and comulativa gains curve, the model chosen was LGBM. In addition, other factor that motivated the choice were, the LGBM being a small size model, which requires less storage use and makes applying it more agile.

Ps.: For the results in table were used k=1000 just to evaluate and comparing the models.

# Machine Learning Model Performance
After LGBM be the applied model chosen, the next step is to adjust the hyperparameters. To do it, was used Optuna, a python library that find the best hyperparameters for the model.

|Model Name		       |PRECISION @K		  |RECALL @K  	|
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|
|LGBM Tuned          |0.470 	          |0.063        |

Note that in this case, the gains comparing tuned and not tuned model, were not satisfactory.

# Business Results

Google sheets doc request in business assumptions is available here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12oexnJCRgMqstAtTf2y8CnciALNvd5rCq97DicaszHs/edit#gid=1134939231

Note: Examples in spreadsheet were got in a random way just to demonstrate how the button works.

To answer the business questions, was used the metrics (Precision and Recall @K) Cumulative Gains Curve and Lift Curve. Where Lift Curve demonstrate how much the rank obtained from applied model is better than a random choice.

<b>1 - What percentage of interested customers, could the sales center contact by calling 20,000?</b>

|Model Name		       |PRECISION @K		  |RECALL @K  	|
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|
|LGBM (20000 calls)  |0.308 	          |0.837        |

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipejaguiar/health_insurance/main/image/q1cgc.png" width="500" height="350" alt="logo" style="zoom:80%;" />

Looking at point that red line crosses orange curve, we realize that you could contact approximately 83.70% of interested customers, making 20000 calls. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipejaguiar/health_insurance/main/image/q1lift.png" width="500" height="350" alt="logo" style="zoom:80%;" />

The Lift Curve shows that the model to 20.000 calls, is approximately 2.6 times better than using a random choice.

<b>2 - What percentage of interested customers, could the sales center contact by calling 40,000?</b>

|Model Name		       |PRECISION @K		  |RECALL @K  	|
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|
|LGBM (40000 calls)  |0.184 	          |0.999        |

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipejaguiar/health_insurance/main/image/q2cgc.png" width="500" height="350" alt="logo" style="zoom:80%;" />

Looking at point that red line crosses orange curve, we realize that you could contact approximately 83.70% of interested customers, making 40000 calls. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipejaguiar/health_insurance/main/image/q2lift.png" width="500" height="350" alt="logo" style="zoom:80%;" />

The Lift Curve shows that the model to 40.000 calls, is approximately 1.5 times better than using a random choice.

<b>3 - To contact 80% of interested customers, how many calls does the center sales needs to make?</b>

|Model Name		       |PRECISION @K		  |RECALL @K  	|
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|
|LGBM (18700 calls)  |0.315 	          |0.801        |

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipejaguiar/health_insurance/main/image/q3cgc.png" width="500" height="350" alt="logo" style="zoom:80%;" />

Looking at point that red line crosses orange curve, we realize that you need making approximately 18700 calls to contact 80% of interested customers. 

# Conclusions

At the end of this project, it was possible answer business questions and solve business problem, giving to sales center a solution for calls restrictions and helping in decision process. Besides it, the project was a good way to improve my knowledge about classification problems (in this case specific Learn to Rank), being possible find new model types, metrics and applications. 

# Next Steps to Improve

 - Search about news machine learning classifiers models;
 - Apply another method to select features, like Boruta;
 - Search and build new features to feed the model;
